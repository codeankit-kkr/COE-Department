    <p>
      About Us The department started offering B.Tech. Programme in <em> Computer
      Engineering </em>in 1987 with initial intake of 30 students and subsequently
      raised to 92. Department also started B.Tech programme in Information
      Technology (IT) in 2006 with present intake of 92 students. The department
      is proud to have a record of almost 100% placement for last 10 years. The
      department also offers two M.Tech. programs, one in Computer Engineering
      and other in Cyber Security. Department started Ph.D. program in 2002. So
      far 44 Ph.D.s have been awarded and 28 PhDs are in progress. Currently
      there are five sponsored projects undergoing in the department. Faculty of
      the department have specialized areas for advanced studies and research in
      Distributed Computing, Software Engineering, Computer Networks, Database
